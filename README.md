# Code Explanation CLI App Documentation

## Step 1: Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (minimum version: 12.x)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Step 2: Obtain OpenAI API Key
### Sign Up/Login to OpenAI:
- If you don't have an account, [sign up for OpenAI here](https://openai.com).
- If you have an account, [log in to the OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com).

### Get Your API Key:
1. Once logged in, navigate to your dashboard or API settings to find your API key.
2. Copy your API key to use it in the CLI app.

## Step 3: Set Up the CLI App
### Clone or Create the Project:
- Clone the repository or create a new directory for the CLI app.
- Navigate to the app directory in your terminal.

### Install Dependencies:
```bash
npm install fs openai
```

# Adding Your OpenAI API Key

1. Open the `index.js` file in your editor.
2. Replace `'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Step 4: Running the CLI App

### Command to Run the App:
In the terminal, execute the CLI app with the following command:
```bash
node index.js path/to/your/file.js
```

Replace path/to/your/file.js with your file path
 
### Viewing Code Explanation

Upon execution, the app will retrieve the code from the specified file and generate an explanation using the OpenAI API. The explanation will be displayed in the terminal.

#### Additional Notes

- **File Path:** Make sure the provided file path exists and contains the code you want to explain.
- **Customization:** Adapt the CLI app's behavior according to your needs, such as adjusting the explanation length or implementing more advanced code analysis.

#### Troubleshooting

- **Invalid API Key:** Double-check that the API key is accurately copied and pasted into the `index.js` file.
- **File Not Found:** Verify the file path provided in the command to ensure the file exists in the specified location.
