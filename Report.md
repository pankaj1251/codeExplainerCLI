# Summary of the project

## Approach Taken
1. **Initialization:** The script initializes the Google PALM API client, reads a file path from the command line arguments, and ensures the file exists.
2. **Reading Code:** It extracts code from the provided file path using Node.js fs (File System) module's readFileSync function.
3. **Calling PALM API:** The extracted code is passed to the PALM API's generateText method as a prompt to request an explanation for the code.
4. **Display Explanation:** The explanation received from the API is then displayed in the terminal.

## Challenges Faced
1. **Error Handling:** The error handling seems minimal. While errors from the PALM API are caught and logged, there might be additional error scenarios to consider, such as network failures or API authentication issues.

## Suggestions for Improvement
1. **Async/Await Consistency:** Consider using async/await consistently across the codebase for better readability and handling of asynchronous operations.
2. **Input Validation:** Add more robust input validation for file paths and content, checking for various edge cases like empty files or non-textual content.
